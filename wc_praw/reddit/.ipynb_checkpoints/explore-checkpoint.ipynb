After talking extensively with mods  outside organizations  and our own teams  we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).\\n\\n## First  a quick recap\\n\\nSince our last post  here’s what we’ve been doing:\\n\\n* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).\\n* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors  clarify our policies  make mods' lives easier  and concretely reduce hate.\\n   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays)  including specific product work we discussed.\\n* **We developed our enforcement plan**  including both our immediate actions (e.g.  today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls  sustainably enforcing the new policies  and advancing Reddit’s community governance).\\n\\nFrom our conversations with mods and outside experts  it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level  [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/)  measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.\\n\\nThese include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit)  aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes  chats  modmail)  and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.\\n\\nUltimately  it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term  this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\\n\\n## New Policy\\n\\nThis is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:\\n\\n* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities  including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.\\n* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\\n   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule  along with specific examples  in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\\n* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic  personal interest.\\n   * Debate and creativity are welcome  but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.\\n* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.\\n\\nAlongside the change to the content policy  we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits  the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities  about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.\\n\\nAll communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so  despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1)  antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8)  and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now  we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings  mod changes  quarantining  and more.\\n\\nThough smaller  r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\\n\\nTo be clear  views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith  without exception.\\n\\n## Our commitment\\n\\nOur policies will never be perfect  with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users  you will always have more context  community vernacular  and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.\\n\\nBut just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support  you need more support from us as well  and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors  abusive behaviors  and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity  discussions  and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment  with today’s update and those to come  makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.\\n\\nEdit: After digesting feedback  we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\", author='spez', created='06-30-2020', over_18=False, edited=1593565818.0, is_original_content=False, locked=False, spoiler=False, num_comments=40429, num_crossposts=82, num_duplicates=79, num_reports=None, num_upvotes=20676, num_downvotes=0),\n",
       " Submission(subreddit_url='/r/announcements/', subreddit_name='announcements', title='Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we’re going from here', selftext=\"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate  a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here  and we still have work to do.**\\n\\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people  I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being  who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin  and as someone who literally has a platform and  with it  a duty to speak out.\\n\\nEarlier this week  I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it  many of the responses said something like  “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”\\n\\nThese questions  which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart  are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company  and what you see in our content policy. \\n\\nOver the last fifteen years  hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users  as mods  and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\\n\\nHowever  as Reddit has grown  alongside much good  it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\\n\\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily  despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \\n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \\n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\\n\\nWe are already working to fix these problems  and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects  it’s served us well. Under it  we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said  we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do  articulates none of the values behind the rules  and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\\n\\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to  a statement on hate  the context for the rules  and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through  and while we will move quickly  I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement  the timeline is weeks  not months.\\n\\nAnd just this morning  Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing)  my Reddit cofounder  announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate  a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.\\n\\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long  I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place  where we have made progress  and where  despite our best intentions  we have fallen short.\\n\\nIn the early days of Reddit  2005–2006  our idealistic “policy” was that  excluding spam  we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested  we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end  we acted based on our beliefs  despite our “policy.” \\n\\nI left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time  in addition to rapid user growth  Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \\n\\nWhen I returned in 2015  my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown  which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment  because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/)  [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/)  [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/)  [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence)  we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \\n\\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves  we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed  both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018  I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules  but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\\n\\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald  a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies  “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit  and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly  we should have quarantined it sooner.\\n\\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism  which makes us proud  and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said  this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \\n\\nDespite making significant progress over the years  we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter  and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\\n\\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual  but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\\n\\nThanks \\n\\nSteve\", author='spez', created='06-06-2020', over_18=False, edited=False, is_original_content=False, locked=False, spoiler=False, num_comments=42011, num_crossposts=84, num_duplicates=54, num_reports=None, num_upvotes=40540, num_downvotes=0),\n",

Further  each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content  we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside the United States  and we only allow political ads at the federal level.\\n\\nThat said  beginning today  we will *also* require political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments “on” for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage directly with users in the comments.\\n\\nIn tandem  we are launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency  which will list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1  2019. In this community  you will find information on the individual advertiser  their targeting  impressions  and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit  so we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along  please subscribe to [r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/) for more information.\\n\\nWe hope this update will give you a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around important political issues  and provide a line of sight into the campaigns and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team  ensuring comments remain enabled for 24 hours  and establishing a political ads transparency subreddit  we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring important conversation  enabling our users to provide their own feedback on political ads  and better protecting the community from inappropriate political ads  bad actors  and misinformation.\\n\\nPlease see the full updated political ads policy below:\\n\\n*All political advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved  the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative (for more information on the managed sales process  please see “Advertising at Scale”* [*here*](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)*.) Political advertisers will also be asked to present additional information to verify their identity and/or authorization to place such advertisements.*\\n\\n*Political advertisements on Reddit include  but are not limited to  the following:*\\n\\n* *Ads related to campaigns or elections  or that solicit political donations;*\\n* *Ads that promote voting or voter registration (discouraging voting or voter registration is not allowed);*\\n* *Ads promoting political merchandise (for example  products featuring a public office holder or candidate  political slogans  etc);*\\n* *Issue ads or advocacy ads pertaining to topics of potential legislative or political importance or placed by political organizations*\\n\\n*Advertisements in this category must include clear \"paid for by\" disclosures within the ad copy and/or creative  and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those promulgated by the Federal Elections Commission. All political advertisements must also have comments enabled for at least the first 24 hours of the ad run. The advertiser is strongly encouraged to engage with Reddit users directly in these comments. The advertisement and any comments must still adhere to Reddit’s* [*Content Policy*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)*.*\\n\\n*Please note additionally that information regarding political ad campaigns and their purchasing individuals or entities may be publicly disclosed by Reddit for transparency purposes.*\\n\\n*Finally  Reddit only accepts political advertisements within the United States  at the federal level. Political advertisements at the state and local level  or outside of the United States are not allowed.*\\n\\n\\\\--------------\\n\\nPlease read our full advertising policy [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy).', author='con_commenter', created='04-14-2020', over_18=False, edited=False, is_original_content=False, locked=False, spoiler=False, num_comments=99661, num_crossposts=18, num_duplicates=18, num_reports=None, num_upvotes=21065, num_downvotes=0),\n",

This year  we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically  a breakdown of content policy removals  content manipulation removals  subreddit removals  and subreddit quarantines.\\n\\n## By the numbers\\n\\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long  I’ll call out a few stats below:\\n\\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\\n\\n* In 2019  we removed **\\\\~53M** pieces of content in total  mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating)  exclusive of legal/copyright removals  which we track separately.\\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations  we removed\\n   * **222k** **pieces of content** \\n   * **55.9k accounts**  and\\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\\n* Additionally  we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\\n\\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\\n\\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content  of which we complied with **37.3%**.\\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018  largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\\n\\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\\n\\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests  mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid  Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\\n\\n## While I have your attention...\\n\\nI’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\\n\\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/)  we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms  it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\\n\\nToday  we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings  followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\\n\\n## If you’ve read this far\\n\\nIn addition to this report  we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit  and if you like posts about what we’re doing  you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity  r/ModNews  r/redditmobile  and r/changelog.\\n\\n**As usual  I’ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments.
