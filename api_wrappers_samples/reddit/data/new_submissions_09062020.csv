/r/announcements/,announcements,Update to Our Content Policy,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/)  we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods  outside organizations  and our own teams  we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First  a quick recap

Since our last post  here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors  clarify our policies  make mods' lives easier  and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays)  including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**  including both our immediate actions (e.g.  today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls  sustainably enforcing the new policies  and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts  it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level  [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/)  measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit)  aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes  chats  modmail)  and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately  it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term  this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities  including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule  along with specific examples  in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic  personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome  but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy  we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits  the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities  about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so  despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1)  antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8)  and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now  we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings  mod changes  quarantining  and more.

Though smaller  r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear  views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith  without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect  with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users  you will always have more context  community vernacular  and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support  you need more support from us as well  and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors  abusive behaviors  and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity  discussions  and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment  with today’s update and those to come  makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback  we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",spez,06-30-2020,False,1593565818.0,False,False,False,40429,82,79,,20671,0
